  <h3>How do earthquakes occur?</h3>
  <p>Earthquakes are usually caused when rock underground suddenly breaks along a fault. This sudden release of energy causes the seismic waves that make the ground shake. When two blocks of rock or two plates are rubbing against each other, they stick
  a little. And,When the rocks break, the earthquake occurs.</p>
  <h3>Why do earthquakes occur?</h3>
  <p>An earthquake is caused by a sudden slip on a fault. When the stress on the edge overcomes the friction, there is an earthquake that releases energy in waves that travel through the earth's crust and cause the shaking that we feel.</p>
  <h3>We cannot prevent earthquakes from occurring but there are some steps that we can do for us to be prepared if earthquakes will occur.Here are five ways to lessen/minimize the effects of earthquakes:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Educate ourselves and our family members.</li>
    <li>We must learn to practice the duck,cover,and hold.</li>
    <li>We must prepare disaster supplies( Emergency food and water, Flashlights, First aid kits,Non Electric can opener,Essential medicines,Cash and credit cards, and etc.)</li>
    <li>Construct buildings that can withstand the force of an earthquake.</li>
    <li>Have earthquake drills in areas that are prone to earthquakes.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Effectivity of the solutions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Educate ourselves and our family members.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        People who most survive in earthquakes are the ones who know what to do so educating ourselves to learn more about earthquake risks and how to be prepared can help us to save ourselves and others .
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>We must learn to practice the duck,cover,and hold.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Drop, Cover, Hold this can help us to avoid being knocked over, and this can help us to protect our head, neck and vital organs.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>We must prepare disaster supplies( Emergency food and water, Flashlights, First aid kits,Non Electric can opener,Essential medicines,Cash and credit cards, and etc.)</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Having an emergency kit is an important step to prepare and protect your household for unforeseen events. An emergency kit is essential for short term survival providing vital items for you, your family or household.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Construct buildings that can withstand the force of an earthquake.</li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Buildings in earthquake-prone areas need to be built on roller foundations, which allow them to move but not collapse during an earthquake.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <li>Have earthquake drills in areas that are prone to earthquakes.</li>
    <ul>
      The purpose of conducting an earthquake drill is to assist personnel to know their roles and responsibilities in an emergency situation in accordance with the workplace plans and procedures. This helps people to know what they're going to do once an earthquake will happen.
    </ul>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p>We need to have enough knowledge on disasters like this so that we will be aware of what we will do if we encounter this in a real life situation. Natural disasters like this can happen
    anytime and anywhere so we must be aware of what we will do so that we can prevent deaths. There are so many ways these disasters can affect our daily lives, for example: In a disaster, people face the danger of death or physical injury.
    People may also lose home, possessions, and community. It may also affect emotional, mental and physical health problems.</p>
