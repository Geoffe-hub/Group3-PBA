    <p>MANILA â€”Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte on Thursday ordered government agencies to rush aid to people affected by Typhoon Ulysses after the storm killed at least two people and brought the worst flooding in the capital Manila in years.
      Tens of thousands of homes in low-lying suburbs were submerged by the floods, prompting residents to scramble onto rooftops awaiting rescue.

    <h3>How do typhoons occur?</h3>
    <p>A typhoon forms when winds blow into areas of the ocean where the water is warm. These winds collect moisture and rise, while colder air moves in below. This creates pressure, which causes the winds to move very quickly. The winds rotate, or
      spin, around a center called an eye.</p>
    <h3>Why do typhoons occur?</h3>
    <p>Typhoons occur when a rough weather wave, using the Earth's rotation, begins to rotate (also known as the Coriolis effect). The potential of generating a pressure system increases if this wave spins into a complete circle; with higher pressure
      on the outside and a low-pressure center.</p>

      <li>Pay attention to the latest weather info and heed warnings.</li>
