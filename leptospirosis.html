              <li>Ways to avoid leptospirosis.</li>
              <li>Solution1: Avoid contact with water, shower as soon as possible, wear protective clothes,wash wounds.</li>
              <p> Why do we need to avoid contact with water
                Prolonged immersion in or swallowing of contaminated water can increase the risk of infection. Direct contact with the urine, other bodily fluids, or tissues of infected animals can also lead to infection, as well as ingestion of food
                or water
                contaminated by Leptospira
                Wearing protective clothes
                Use PPE to create a barrier to avoid exposure to urine or urine-contaminated water and soil. When working in risky environments, PPE should be waterproof
                Wash wounds
                Treatment for leptospirosis has the most chance of success if it begins as soon as exposure to infection is known or suspected. It is important to display first aid advice in work areas, provide a first aid kit, and follow first aid
                procedures.
                A readily available supply. of clean water is important when exposure is known or suspected.

                Solution2: Avoid touching objects that may be contaminated with animal urine
              </li>
              <p>such as animal bedding. Don't wade, swim, or put your head in floodwaters or water from lakes, rivers, or swamps. Especially avoid freshwater contact after flooding or heavy rain
              </p>
              <li>Solution3: Don't wade, swim, or put your head in floodwaters or water from lakes, rivers, or swamps
              </li>
              <p>Loodwaters contain many things that may harm health. We donâ€™t know exactly what is in floodwater at any given point in time,It is important to protect yourself from exposure to flood water regardless of the source of contamination.
                The best way
                to protect yourself is to stay out of the water
